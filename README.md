NeuroMEA_Toolbox
================

Simple MATLAB Electrophysiology Analysis Tools

Descrition:
This code is meant to be used to analyze electrophyisiology data acquired using micro electrode arrays.
MEA_Analysis is meant for analyzing Local field potential recordings acuired from hippocampal slices
NeruonalCulture is meant for detecting spikes and netwrok bursting from local field potential recordings in neuronal cultures. 

NOTE:Code is still a work in progress.
